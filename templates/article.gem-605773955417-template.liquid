  <div data-label="Text Block" class="element-wrap" data-description data-key="text-block"> <div class="elm text-edit"><p>All around the world, people are embracing the myriad benefits of cannabis, and Malta is no exception. As the global attitude towards cannabis shifts, more and more people are looking to cultivate this incredible plant.</p>
<p>Malta, with its progressive cannabis legislation, has become a popular destination for tourists who want to enjoy cannabis without legal consequences. Seedz.mt, your local cannabis seed bank, is at the forefront of this green revolution, offering high-quality seeds for those looking to cultivate their own plants.</p>
<h2>Malta's Progressive Cannabis Legislation:</h2>
<p>In 2021, Malta introduced the Act on the Responsible Use of Cannabis, which decriminalized the personal use and cultivation of cannabis. Under the new legislation, individuals can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase up to 7 grams of cannabis every 24 hours and up to 50 grams per month</li>
<li>Carry up to 7 grams of cannabis in public</li>
<li>Possess up to 50 grams of cannabis per household</li>
<li>Cultivate up to 4 cannabis plants per household, as long as they are not visible to the public</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Malta has also established cannabis clubs, which are non-profit organizations that provide cannabis to their members. These associations can sell up to 7 grams of cannabis per day and 50 grams per month to their members, and cultivators can buy up to 20 cannabis seeds per month from these clubs.<br><br>Despite the new legislation, there are still some restrictions in place. Smoking cannabis in public is prohibited, and adults caught smoking in front of minors can face fines. Cannabis possession by minors will not result in arrest, but the local justice board will be contacted to construct a care plan for them.</p>
